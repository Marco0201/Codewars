# Optimizations
I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.
# Lessons Learned
The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling the questions in codewars is that not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve. There is also no harm in looking at a solution and trying to understand where you went wrong. And it may take a while to really understand how to solve a problem.
